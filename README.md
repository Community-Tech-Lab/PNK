**The Portable Network Kit (PNK)**

The Portable Network Kit (PNK) is a wireless network in a suitcase that helps people understand how to build their own mini-internet – and with it, how the internet works and might be owned and governed more equitably. Originally conceived as a network repair kit for Resilient Networks for RISE: NYC in New York City, the kits were repurposed to work both as a teaching tool and as an emergency standalone wireless network. PNKs consist of off-the-shelf hardware and open-source software housed in a waterproof, battery-powered, solar-enabled kit. The kits can be used to connect to an existing internet connection or offline as a local wireless networking system, complete with its own server, chat service, and document editor.

PNKs are NOT a product – we don’t sell them off-the-shelf. CTNY uses PNKs when training community members in network development and deployment, giving them practical hands-on experience that can serve as a springboard for building their own networks with in-person or remote learning support.

If you're interested in a training or workshop with the PNK, please get in touch.

**History & Partners**

PNK was originally developed in 2017 by Community Tech NY through the Resilient Networks NYC project, a 5-neighborhood NYC mesh networking partnership among New America’s Resilient Communities program, The Point CDC, the Fifth Avenue Committee, the Kings Bay Y, Silicon Harlem, and the Rockaway Development and Revitalization Corporation. Resilient Networks NYC was supported by the New York City Economic Development Corporation’s RISE : NYC program, a Superstorm Sandy recovery effort. 

Currently, it is being expanded and maintained by the Community Tech Lab, a partnership between Community Tech NY and El Puente de Williamsburg, and supported by The Altman Foundation and the New York Community Trust (NYCT).

This server documentation and software are free and open source, made possible by funding from the Internet Society Foundation (ISOC).
