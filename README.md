# **About The Portable Network Kit**

The **Portable Network Kit (PNK)** is a wireless network in a suitcase that helps people understand how to build their own mini-internet – and with it, how the internet works and might be owned and governed more equitably. Originally conceived as a network repair kit for [Resilient Networks for RISE: NYC](https://www.newamerica.org/resilient-communities/flexible-future-ready-networks/rise-nyc/) in New York City, the kits were repurposed to work both as a teaching tool and as an emergency standalone wireless network. 

## **History & Partners**

PNK was originally developed in 2017 by [Community Tech NY](https://www.communitytechny.org/) through the Resilient Networks NYC project, a 5-neighborhood NYC mesh networking partnership among [New America’s Resilient Communities program](https://www.newamerica.org/resilient-communities/), [The Point CDC](https://www.thepoint.org/), [the Fifth Avenue Committee](https://hcr.ny.gov/location/fifth-avenue-committee-inc), the Kings Bay Y, [Silicon Harlem](https://siliconharlem.com/), and the [Rockaway Development and Revitalization Corporation](https://www.rdrc.org/). Resilient Networks NYC was supported by the New York City Economic Development Corporation’s RISE:NYC program, a Superstorm Sandy recovery effort. 

Currently, it is being expanded and maintained by the Community Tech Lab, a partnership between Community Tech NY and [El Puente de Williamsburg](https://www.elpuente.org/), and supported by [The Altman Foundation](https://www.altmanfoundation.org/) and [the New York Community Trust (NYCT)](https://thenytrust.org/).

This server documentation and software are free and open source, made possible by funding from the [Internet Society Foundation (ISOC)](https://www.internetsociety.org/).

## **What Is A PNK?**

**PNKs** consist of off-the-shelf hardware and open-source software housed in a waterproof, battery-powered, solar-enabled kit. The kits can be used to connect to an existing internet connection or offline as a local wireless networking system, complete with its own server, chat service, and document editor.

### **Software**
The open-source software of the PNK establishes a local wireless networking system, featuring its own shared server, chat service, and document editor. It provides access to self-contained and self-maintained communication and collaboration tools.

**PNKs are NOT a product** – _[Community Tech NY](https://www.communitytechny.org/) does not sell them off-the-shelf. [CTNY](https://www.communitytechny.org/) uses PNKs when training community members in network development and deployment, giving them practical hands-on experience that can serve as a springboard for building their own networks with in-person or remote learning support._

**The PNK project was developed with a strong commitment to community collaboration and shared progress. We encourage you to use and contribute to it in a spirit of collective improvement and mutual benefit, ensuring that it serves the greater good and fosters positive innovation.**
